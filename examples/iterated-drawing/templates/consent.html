                <p>This research is being conducted by Jordan Suchow, a postdoctoral research fellow, and Tom Griffiths, a faculty member, at UC Berkeley. This study takes 5 minutes.</p>

                <p>If you agree to take part in the research, you will complete a study that involves looking at a hand-drawn charcter and creating a new example of it. All of the information we obtain during the research will be kept confidential, and not associated with your name in any way, however, while the study is running it will be associated with your MTurk worker id. Once the study is complete, we will replace your worker id with a random string.</p>

                <p>Your participation in this research is voluntary. You are free to refuse to take part, and you may stop taking part at any time. You are free to discontinue participation in this study at any time with no penalty.</p>

                <p>If you have any questions about this research, do not hesitate to contact Jordan at suchow@berkeley.edu. If you have any questions about your rights or treatment as a participant in this research project, please contact UC Berkeley's Committee for Protection of Human Subjects at (510) 642&ndash;7461 or subjects@berkeley.edu.</p>
